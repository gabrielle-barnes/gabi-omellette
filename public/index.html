          Welcome to Gabi's Omellette! It's my personal website project where I

        <h3>About Me</h3>

        <p>
          Hi! My name is Gabi (she/her), and I want to make an old school
          internet website. It's a creative side project for me and helps me
          code regularly while job searching. In the future I'd like to get a
          master's degree for sustainable technologies.
        </p>

        <p>
          I also love to read, my favorite moments in life were when I was
          analyzing books either in class or for book club.
        </p>

        <p>
          I almost forget the reason why it's called Gabi's Omellette is because
          I read this book called Balzac's Omelette. Which is about this famous
          French author who would either only drink coffee or go on crazy eating
          binges. He was also constantly writing about food in his books. I have
          better eating habits but I thought the name was cute. Also I
          accidently mispelled omelette when I first made the website but as Bob
          Ross says "We don't make mistakes, just happy little accidents."
