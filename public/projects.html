              <p class="project_description">
                While a volunteer, I used <em>AddaxAI</em>,
                <em>MegaDetector</em> and <em>SpeciesNet</em> to analyze the
                camera trap photos they had (animals & people are labeled). Got
                the idea to integrate the technology from the work of

                I did an internship @ Microsoft Research as an undergraduate and
                worked on integrating LLMs into a genetic algorithm to improve
                the capabilities of finding molecules with specific desired
                properties. My direct mentor was

                For my undergrad senior group project, I designed and improved
                the AI agents' behavior for a social-deception game called
                <em>Synthergy</em>. We were advised by
